# Security Model

DevSpace exposes local coding capabilities over MCP. Treat it as remote access
to your development machine.

The security model is simple:

- you choose a narrow filesystem allowlist
- the MCP endpoint requires OAuth approval with your Owner password
- Host headers are allowlisted from the configured public URL
- every coding action happens through explicit MCP tool calls

## Filesystem Allowlist

DevSpace only opens workspaces under configured roots.

Good examples:

```text
~/work
~/personal/open-source
```

Avoid broad roots:

```text
~
/
C:\
```

The narrower the root, the easier it is to reason about what the MCP client can
reach.

## Owner Password

`devspace init` generates an Owner password and stores it in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

When an MCP client connects, DevSpace shows an approval page. Enter the Owner
password only when you intentionally want that client to access this server.

For env-driven deployments, set a long random value:

```bash
DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

## Public URL And Host Allowlist

DevSpace needs `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so MCP clients can discover OAuth
metadata and connect to the correct resource.

The value should be the origin only:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Do not include `/mcp` in `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

By default, DevSpace derives allowed Host headers from the local host and public
URL. Use `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*` only for intentional local debugging.

## Tunnels

DevSpace does not manage tunnels. Your tunnel or reverse proxy should point to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676
```

Prefer adding Cloudflare Access, Tailscale identity controls, or equivalent
protection in front of public tunnels. DevSpace OAuth still protects the MCP
endpoint, but the tunnel URL should not be treated as a secret.

## Shell Access

The shell tool is powerful by design. It is meant for tests, builds, git, and
package scripts.

Filesystem path containment applies to DevSpace file tools. Shell commands run
as local commands and can do what your user account can do. This is why the MCP
client must be trusted and the Owner password must stay private.

## Worktrees

Managed worktrees reduce accidental edits to your active checkout, but they are
not a security boundary. They are a workflow boundary for isolated coding
sessions.

## Native File Download

Native file download is an opt-in, one-shot transfer into an already-open
workspace. `download_artifact` accepts the MCP host's native file value, the
`workspaceId` returned by `open_workspace`, and an unused relative destination
path. It returns only the workspace-relative path and does not create a
persistent artifact service or reusable artifact ID.

DevSpace accepts only the documented native-file object and trusted OpenAI
download hosts and redirects. Arbitrary URL strings, local source paths,
credentials, malformed references, and unknown object fields are rejected.

Absolute paths, traversal, symlinked parents, and existing destinations also
fail closed. Downloads stream under the configured per-file limit and are
published without overwrite as owner-only files. DevSpace does not extract or
execute transferred content.

## Logs

By default, DevSpace logs requests and tool calls. Shell command previews are
disabled unless `DEVSPACE_LOG_SHELL_COMMANDS=1`.

Do not enable shell command logging if commands may contain secrets.

Artifact tool logs contain bounded workspace ID, validated hostname,
workspace-relative output path, byte count, hash, duration, and status metadata.
`download_artifact` does not log the opaque file value. Raw content, connector
references, native file IDs, bearer credentials, presigned URLs, host paths,
temporary paths, and base64 chunks are never included in tool logs or tool
results.

## Authentication Profiles And Authorization

DevSpace supports two approval profiles. `owner_token` is intended for controlled local single-owner use. `trusted_header` is intended for a user-controlled identity gateway that authenticates the subject and produces an HMAC proof bound to the request context. The identity headers are not an identity provider by themselves; the gateway must protect the signing secret, validate the upstream identity, and prevent forged or replayed assertions.

Issued tokens carry an authenticated principal context in addition to client, resource, expiry, and scopes. MCP sessions are bound to the principal, client, and resource. A token for another principal cannot reuse an existing MCP session even when the client and resource are the same.

Scopes remain compatibility controls. `read` permits discovery and read-only tools; `write` permits mutating workspace, process, patch, and artifact operations. The legacy umbrella `devspace` scope is broad and should be limited to controlled compatibility deployments until explicit role-based permissions are available.

MCP tool authorization is fail-closed. Every known tool must have an explicit read or write classification. Unknown or malformed tool calls are rejected before handler dispatch rather than being implicitly treated as read-only. Shell execution, process input, artifact download, file writes, and patch application should be treated as high-risk operations and must not be exposed to a read-only token.

This authorization layer does not replace filesystem containment or operating-system permissions. Shell commands execute with the local user's authority, so the allowed-root configuration, trusted client boundary, and gateway controls remain essential.
